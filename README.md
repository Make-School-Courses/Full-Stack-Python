# Full Stack Python

## Course Description

Welcome to your first term at Make School! This course is a combination of our CS 1.1 and BEW 1.1 courses, with topics interlaced in order to give you a cohesive and complimentary learning experience. You'll learn how to turn specifications and word problems into code, build websites from the ground up, get familiar with a new language, and everything in between. 

### Why you should know this

This course will provide you with the first set of foundational knowledge you will need to be a successful software engineer. Getting familiar with your first stack and learning core CS and BEW concepts will set you up for success in the rest of your courses here at Make School, as well as your engineering career.

## Class Assignments

### Homework

In addition to the assignments below, you will have smaller coding challenges, generally assigned at the end of a class. Please refer to the individual lesson materials for instructions/due dates on these smaller assignments

### Quizzes

There will be **11 quizzes** held during this course. **Please reference the above schedule for quiz topics and dates.** These quizzes will be used in place of a final exam. Your lowest two quiz scores will be dropped, so your _total quiz score will be based off of the other nine_.

Quizzes will cover all topics outlined in the schedule, with the **exception** of the following:

- Any lab days
- Final Contractor Project Presentations
- Herd Immunity Simulation

### Code Reviews and Pair Programming Sessions

Throughout this course, you will be required to seek out **3 code reviews** and conduct **2 pair programming** sessions on specific assignments. **These will be requirements that must be completed for submitting your assginment.** You will learn about code reviews and pair programming in learning sessions during the first few weeks of the term.

For code reviews, you must submit the name of the code reviewer and a link to the commit they reviewed in the tracker.

For pair programming sessions, you must submit the name of your partner in the tracker.

Please refer to class materials to see which assignments require code reviews or pair programming sessions.

### Tutorials

**Note: Please reference the above schedule for tutorial due dates.**

- [Captain Rainbow's Color Checklist](https://make.sc/rainbow-checklist): Get more practice writing functions in Python, and learn a basic understanding of what it means to CRUD a resource!
- [Super Hero Team Dueler](http://make.sc/superhero-team-dueler): Apply your OOP knowledge by building a super hero game!
- [Playlistr](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/playlistr-video-playlists-with-flask-and-mongodb-1c): Video playlists with Flask and MongoDB!


### Projects

**Note 1: Please reference the above schedule for project due dates.**

**Note 2:** Project specs are listed below. For each project, the rubric (how you will be graded) is linked within each spec. A project will not be considered complete unless it satisfies all of the the requirements as outlined in the spec. 

- [GIF Search](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1symUDRsZ1i2xf8F2mwAGFJtLjbOXqCj0JyrIgTtFNT0/edit?usp=sharing): Build a website that searches GIFs using the Tenor API
- [Mad Libs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1suR3hzqfGSL9o99rNbDrcU0N1Z47EREubP38IY4Ptuc/edit?usp=sharing): Build a mad libs game in your terminal using Python
- [Spaceman](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y1WPgJERAuLRJjeSXTf5znjhsrtPjnzPKfD03_f6v7w/edit?usp=sharing): Build a word guessing game in your terminal using Python
- [Herd Immunity Simulation](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/CS-1.1-Intro-to-Programming/blob/master/Projects/HerdImmunity): Apply all of your learnings from your CS lessons to create a simulation that models how a virus moves through a population where some (but not all) of a population is vaccinated against this virus.
- [Contractor Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C8eOyLBeGMKJ2y50QwLU5tWjNb2JVcpAE4khUBIfm0U/edit?usp=sharing): Apply all of your learnings from your BEW lessons to create a website for a store of your choosing!

## Evaluation

Due to the combined nature of this course, evaluation will be based on the evaluation criteria of each individual course. **To pass this class, you must meet the evaluation criteria of both courses.** If you satisfy the criteria for one course but not the other, you will need to re-take that course in a future term.

For example, if by the end of the term you meet the evaluation criteria for CS 1.1 but not BEW 1.1, you would have to take BEW 1.1 in a future term.

### Individual Evaluation Criteria

#### [CS 1.1](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/CS-1.1-Intro-to-Programming#evaluation)

#### [BEW 1.1](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/BEW-1.1-RESTful-and-Resourceful-MVC-Architecture#evaluation)
